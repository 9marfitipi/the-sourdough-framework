You can also fine-tune the sky replacement with sliders for horizon blending, sky global, sky local, relight scene, and more.
 
## AI Skin Enhancer & Portrait Enhancer
 
If you work with portraits, you will love the AI Skin Enhancer and Portrait Enhancer tools in Luminar v4.1.1.5343. These tools use human-aware technology to enhance your portraits faster than ever.
 
The AI Skin Enhancer can automatically detect and remove skin imperfections such as blemishes, acne, wrinkles, and more. It also smooths the skin without losing texture or details.
 
The Portrait Enhancer can adjust various aspects of the face and body, such as eye whitening, eye enlargement, face slimming, lip saturation, teeth whitening, and more.
 
You can apply these tools selectively to different areas of the face or body with masks or brushes.
 
## AI Structure
 
Another amazing tool in Luminar v4.1.1.5343 is the AI Structure tool, which can quickly reveal important parts of each image without spoiling the rest of the photo.
 
This content-aware tool detects areas that could look richer and enhances them with sliders for amount and boost. It also preserves natural colors and skin tones.
 
You can use masks or brushes to apply the AI Structure effect selectively to different parts of your image.
 
## Sunrays
 
If you want to add some drama and magic to your photos, you can use the Sunrays tool in Luminar v4.1.1.5343 to create realistic light rays.
 
You can add a source of sunlight and move it around your image with a simple drag-and-drop. You can also adjust the sunrays parameters such as amount, look, number, length, penetration, warmth, and more.
 
Luminar will automatically calculate how the sunrays interact with objects such as trees and buildings in your scene and create volumetric effects accordingly.
 
## AI Enhance
 
If you want to quickly improve your photos without spending too much time on complex adjustments, you can use the AI Enhance tool in Luminar v4.1.1.5343.
 
This tool uses artificial intelligence to analyze your image and make dozens of complex adjustments when you move just one slider: AI Accent.
 
The AI Accent slider can automatically enhance exposure, contrast, saturation, clarity, shadows, highlights, and more in your image.
 
New in Luminar v4.1.1.5343 is the human-aware technology that recognizes people in your photos and applies adjustments selectively for ultra-realistic results.
