Houdini 4 can play Chess960 with any compatible interface that supports this mode.

Houdini 4 can adapt to any situation and challenge you in different ways.
 
Houdini 4 also has a position learning feature that enables it to remember the evaluations and best moves for positions that it has analyzed before. This feature improves the speed and accuracy of Houdini's analysis, and also helps you to learn from your mistakes and avoid repeating them in future games.
 
Another useful feature of Houdini 4 is its ability to save and load its hash table to a file. This feature allows you to resume your analysis from where you left off, without losing any information or wasting time. You can also share your hash files with other users or use them for reference.
