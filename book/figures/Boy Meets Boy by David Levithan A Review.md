The main plot revolves around Paul's relationship with Noah, a new boy in town who shares his passion for music and art. Paul falls for Noah instantly, but their romance is complicated by Paul's ex-boyfriend Kyle, who wants him back, and by Joni, Paul's best friend who disapproves of Noah. Paul has to balance his feelings for Noah with his loyalty to his friends, while also dealing with other issues such as his friend Tony's homophobic parents, his friend Infinite Darlene's rivalry with another drag queen, and his school's unique traditions and events.
 
Boy Meets Boy is a refreshing and optimistic take on the genre of LGBTQ+ fiction, as it portrays a world where homophobia and discrimination are almost nonexistent, and where everyone can be themselves without fear or judgment. Levithan's writing style is witty and engaging, and his characters are diverse and realistic. The novel explores themes such as friendship, identity, love, and happiness, and shows that no matter what challenges life throws at you, you can always find your way to your true self and your true love.
 
If you are looking for a fun and uplifting read that will make you smile and warm your heart, you should definitely check out Boy Meets Boy by David Levithan. You can download the PDF version of the book for free from the Internet Archive[^1^] [^2^] [^3^], or you can buy a hardcover or paperback copy from your favorite online or local bookstore.

One of the most appealing aspects of Boy Meets Boy is the way Levithan creates a utopian setting where diversity is celebrated and accepted. Paul's high school is a place where everyone can express their sexuality and gender identity freely, without facing any prejudice or bullying. The school has a Gay-Straight Alliance, a cheerleading squad composed of bikers, and a musical production of Romeo and Juliet with a twist. Paul's town is also a place where gay couples can hold hands in public, where drag queens can run for homecoming queen and win, and where parents are supportive and understanding of their children's choices.
 
However, this does not mean that Paul's world is perfect or unrealistic. Levithan also shows that even in a tolerant and progressive society, people still have to deal with personal and interpersonal conflicts, such as jealousy, betrayal, insecurity, and loneliness. Paul's relationship with Noah is not always smooth sailing, as they have to overcome misunderstandings, trust issues, and external pressures. Paul's friendship with Joni is also tested by her new boyfriend Chuck, who is rude and manipulative. Paul's friend Tony has to cope with his parents' religious beliefs that condemn his homosexuality. Levithan does not shy away from portraying the challenges and struggles that teenagers face in their everyday lives, regardless of their sexual orientation or gender identity.
 
Another remarkable feature of Boy Meets Boy is the way Levithan uses humor and wit to tell his story. The novel is full of hilarious scenes and dialogues that will make you laugh out loud. For example, when Paul meets Noah for the first time at a bookstore, he tries to impress him by pretending to be interested in a book called The Joy of Gay Sex. However, he soon realizes that Noah is actually holding a book called The Joys of Gay Sex, and that he has picked up the wrong one. Paul then tries to cover up his mistake by saying that he was looking for The Joy Luck Club by Amy Tan. Levithan also uses humor to poke fun at some stereotypes and clichÃ©s about gay culture, such as the obsession with musicals, fashion, and pop divas.
